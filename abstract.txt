"A Scene Graph for Modern Browsers"

Scenery (http://phetsims.github.io/scenery/) is a library created
by PhET Interactive Simulations for creating interactive
2D applications. Its core is built around a scene graph
abstraction (Shapes, Text, Images, Nodes, etc. in a hierarchy)
capable of being displayed with multiple technologies (Canvas/SVG/DOM and
WebGL in the future).

One of its core goals is to deliver good performance across a number of
devices while keeping application code clear and concise. If something
is faster on the iPad using SVG with CSS3 transforms for each object,
on IE with Canvas, and WebGL with Chrome/Firefox, we shouldn't have to
deliver three separate implementations!

We'll cover an overview of the power of this approach, along with
current and planned performance optimizations and features,
and potential drawbacks.
